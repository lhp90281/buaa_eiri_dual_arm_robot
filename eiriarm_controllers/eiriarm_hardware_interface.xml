      Topic-based Hardware Interface for ros2_control.
      
      This bridge allows ros2_control to work with systems that communicate via topics,
      such as simulators (MuJoCo, Gazebo Classic) or real robots with topic-based drivers.
      
      It subscribes to /joint_states and publishes to /ctrl/effort, making it compatible
      with existing topic-based systems without requiring code changes to the simulator
      or robot driver.
      
      This is particularly useful for:
      - Gradual migration from topic-based to ros2_control architecture
      - Systems where the low-level driver uses topics (common in real robots)
      - Testing controllers with different simulators
